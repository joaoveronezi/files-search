# File Search System

This app aims to provide the best possible user experience for uploading files and searching for content inside them.

## Key Technologies

### Front-end

- **Vite.js** – Chosen because it's light-weight. It provides a super fast dev experience, it has only the necessary bult-in features and it's great to create lean SPA applications.

### Back-end

- **Node.JS + Express** – It provides full-control of the file parsing, performance, timeouts, etc. And it's easier to scale and maintain.

### Database & Storage

- **Supabase** – Combines PostgreSQL for full-text search with file storage. So that way we can perform quick searches and in the future save files.
